## Automating Exon Detection

This repository is for our project to find new exons in splice-isoforms segments. Cameron Kato and Elliot Meyer are seeking to identify a way to automate the novel process used to identify
splice isoforms. alternative splicing has not yet been characterized comprehensively for any human synaptogenic molecule except Kirrel3, despite the permanently growing publicly available archive 
of transcriptome sequencing data. The project aims to automate further and test the pipeline for the analysis of transcript sequencing data originally developed for the study of Kirrel3 and is a joint 
collaboration between Dr. Trankner (Research Assistant Professor, Department of Neurobiology), Data Science student Cameron Kato, and Elliot Meyer. 

This work is important for three reasons. First, our automated analyses pipeline will eventually be publicly available and, thus, allow researchers worldwide to analyze splice isoforms for their genes of 
interest more efficiently. Second, with the automated pipeline, researchers can more easily reproduce and validate already published findings on splicing. Third, our work will set the stage for potentially 
important future discoveries on human brain evolution and mental or neurodevelopmental disorders by allowing the fast and comprehensive analyses of splice-isoforms of other brain-relevant genes.
